# Landify Design - Flutter Web Implementation

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This project is a Flutter web implementation of the Landify Landing Page UI Kit. The UI design was provided by the Figma community and has been converted into a functional web application using Flutter.

> **Note:** This is my learning project to explore website development and Flutter.

## üåê Live Demo

You can access the live demo [here](https://landify-design-flutter.vercel.app).

## üé® Design Reference

This project is based on the [Landify - Landing Page UI Kit v2](<https://www.figma.com/design/088L8rIAnc29ArpVGDNG5y/Landify---Landing-Page-UI-Kit-v2-(Community)?node-id=1973-6598&t=KM6f0RjBK3Yq0WT8-0>) from Figma Community.

## üé• Responsive Demo

Below is a Video demonstrating the responsive design of the Landify Landing Page, built with Flutter. The site seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üìÅ Responsive Design Utilities

The project includes two important classes, `Breakpoints` and `ResponsiveRowColumn`, which are essential for creating a responsive design.

### Breakpoints

The `breakpoint.dart` file contains a custom class designed to define breakpoints for different device sizes, including mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop. This class is inspired by the [responsive_framework](https://pub.dev/packages/responsive_framework) library but has been tailored to suit specific needs.

#### Purpose

The goal of creating this custom breakpoint class is to:

- **Customize Breakpoints**: Adjust the design to fit specific requirements and preferences.
- **Reduce Rebuilds**: Minimize unnecessary rebuilds by avoiding the use of additional variables like screen width or height.

### ResponsiveRowColumn

The `ResponsiveRowColumn` class is copied from the `responsive_framework` package. It is used to switch easily between a row and a column layout depending on the screen size, enhancing the responsive design capabilities.
